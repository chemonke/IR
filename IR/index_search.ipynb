      "abstract: in a survey of occupational accident cases admitted to malmö general hospital during a period in 1974, interviews were carried out with the accident victims, and, at their work places, with their fellow-workers, safety delegates, and management representatives as well. the interviewees were asked to express their views on aspects of the occupation environment, which might have had a bearing on the causes of the accident in question, for instance noise, harmful substances, physical and mental stress and accident risks. the results showed wide variations between the views of the four groups regarding the same environment situation and the actual accident. often the explanations were rather descriptions of \"supernatural\" concepts in other words. this means that in this field there is a great need for an objective instrument for the analysis of accidents and their circumstances. there is no such instrument available today and there is a growing need to develop accident research and its methods, as well as of a practical instrument for the safety work. there is also a need for a more qualitative analysis of accidents. to this end we used a model developed by j. surry (4) and later modified by the swedish work environment fund (5). a further development of this model is proposed .\n",

      "abstract: a morphological description of the mature os penis and its related structures in the rat is presented. the description aims at being a natural introduction to studies of histomorphological and histochemical events during the development of the bone. the causal interest of this topic is due to a recently published observation of a rare reaction for presence of alkaline phosphatase in the proximally positioned growth cartilage of os penis. the study, thus, presents a systematical description of the position of os penis in relation to the soft tissue structures of glans penis, of gross morphology of the bone, of its periosteal covering and of the distribution of the bone types, which together form the mature bone. the observations result in an introduction of a systematical terminology, based on the latin language. furthermore, certain phenomena concerning a distally positioned cartilagenous process, and the distribution of bone tissue types in os penis are observed and discussed. together with the phenomenon earlier mentioned these phenomena need further attention in future studies of the bone .\n",

      "abstract: tje paper describes the ultrastructure of axons in the endings of various types from the corium in the glans penis in green monkey. in the meissner's endings the axons are mostly completely enveloped in the plasma of schwann cells. they contain numerous mitochondria which are partially vacuolated or are quite converted into vacuoles. next, there are pseudomyelinated figures, light vesicles and further organelles. in the papillar simple glomerular endings with accumulation of schwann cells there are axons irregular in shape, eccentrically placed in the plasma of schwann cell, rounded smaller axons either completely or partially surrounded by the plasma of schwann cell and finally axons with a concentric system of lamellae up to four in number, in the complicated glomerular endings the axons vary in appearance and are enveloped in one to five lamellae of schwann cells, which is typical of those formations. about some of these systems there is a sign of a capsule formed by an elongated lamella probably of the perineurium. when the axons are not enveloped in the plasma of schwann cell, they are covered by the basement membrane. in close neighbourhood of the epidermis so-called free endings forming groups were found. the plasma of schwann cell covers them either partially or completely or it again forms around them a lamellar system amounting up to four layers. it is noticeable that these axons are very poor in organelles. a comparison of the simple sensory corpuscles in the nose skin in hedgehog, the funtional properties of meissner's endings and the simple corpuscles results in the view that the complexes having a larger amount of lamellae correspond to an extent to the simple sensory corpuscles ant that the meissner's endings and the complicated glomerules are probably a morphological and functional equivalent of simple sensory corpuscles in the non-primate mammals and that the gloverular endings may also be the first (developmental) stage of the simple sensory corpuscles .\n",

      "abstract: the literature on benign transient lymphangiectasis of the penis (btlp) was reviewed; reports of 45 cases were collected and a further series, comprising 21 cases, is presented. both the published and present series support the view that btlp is associated with recent sexual activity; little support is given for an infective cause and it is confirmed that btlp is a benign, self-limiting condition presenting in the sexually active man between 20 and 40 years old. there can be recurrences, and susceptibility to them may be encouraged by circumcision in which disturbances of lymphatic drainage may play a part. as so few cases have been reported and few were diagnosed in the present series these comments can only be pointers to further studies. the descriptions in six histological examinations, the reports as `phlebitis' of apparently similar lesions, the report of `sclerosing lymphangitis' in other sites, and the known histological similarity between veins and lymphatics suggest that `sclerosing lymphangitis' is too specific a term. until further knowledge is available, we suggest that this condition is best regarded as simple dilatation of a lymphatic vessel-namely, lymphangiectasis. as the condition is both benign and transient we propose the term benign transient lymphangiectasis of the penis for the condition formerly known as sclerosing lymphangitis .\n",
